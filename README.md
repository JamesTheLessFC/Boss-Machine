# Boss Machine

In this Codecademy project, I created an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. It successfully creates routes to manage your 'minions', your brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.

## Project Overview

You can view a video demonstration of the final app here:

## How to Begin

To start, download the starting code for this project <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/PRO/skill-paths/backend-javascript/projects/boss-machine/project-4-boss-machine-start.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. After downloading the zip folder, double click it to uncompress it and access the contents.

Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project and build the front-end application. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. The `npm run start` script will automatically restart your server whenever you make changes to the **server.js** file or **server/** folder. If you want to turn this off, simply start your server with the `node server.js` command. You can kill either process with the `Ctrl + C` command.

To see the application in its initial, non-working state, simply open **index.html** in a web browser. You should use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (at least version 60) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (at least version 55). The links above will let you download the latest release of either browser if you do not have it or are unsure of which version you're running.

## Implementation Details

To complete the project, you will need to complete code in a few sections of the project. Generally, you will not have to touch anything inside the **browser**, **public**, or **node_modules** folders unless you know some React and HTML/CSS and want to customize the look of the Boss Machine. Before doing any of that, however, let's focus on getting the API server up and running:

### Server Boilerplate

In **server.js**, you will see some boilerplate code, but the server is missing key functionality to allow it to run. You must:

- Set up body-parsing middleware with the `body-parser` packagae.
- Set up CORS middleware with the `cors` package. You can use the default settings.
- Mount the existing `apiRouter` at `/api`. This router will serve as the starting point for all your API routes.
- Start the server listening on the provided `PORT`. Make sure to use the `PORT` constant and not a hard-coded number, as this is required for tests to run.

Take note of the comments in **server.js**, as your code needs to fit into specific places around the existing boilerplate.

### API Routes

- Your routes should live inside the **server** folder. The file and router structure is up to you, the testing suite will only test whether your API endpoints work as intended, not how you nest your code!
- Your 'database' exists in **server/db.js**. The beginning database will be seeded every time the server is restarted. There is more information on working with the database and the helper functions it exports below.

#### Routes Required

- `/api/minions`
  - GET /api/minions to get an array of all minions.
  - POST /api/minions to create a new minion and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/minions/:minionId to get a single minion by id.
  - PUT /api/minions/:minionId to update a single minion by id.
  - DELETE /api/minions/:minionId to delete a single minion by id.
- `/api/ideas`
  - GET /api/ideas to get an array of all ideas.
  - POST /api/ideas to create a new idea and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/ideas/:ideaId to get a single idea by id.
  - PUT /api/ideas/:ideaId to update a single idea by id.
  - DELETE /api/ideas/:ideaId to delete a single idea by id.
- `/api/meetings`
  - GET /api/meetings to get an array of all meetings.
  - POST /api/meetings to create a new meeting and save it to the database.
  - DELETE /api/meetings to delete _all_ meetings from the database.

### Custom Middleware

- You will create a custom middleware function `checkMillionDollarIdea` that will come in handy in some /api/ideas routes. Write this function in the **server/checkMillionDollarIdea.js** file. This function will make sure that any new or updated ideas are still worth at least one million dollars! The total value of an idea is the product of its `numWeeks` and `weeklyRevenue` properties.

### Bonus

As a bonus, you may implement routes to allow bosses to add and remove work from their minions' backlogs.

Schema:

- Work:
  - id: string
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - hours: number
  - minionId: string

Routes required:

- GET /api/minions/:minionId/work to get an array of all work for the specified minon.
- POST /api/minions/:minionId/work to create a new work object and save it to the database.
- PUT /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to update a single work by id.
- DELETE /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to delete a single work by id.

## Testing

A testing suite has been provided for you, checking for all essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install all necessary testing dependencies (you will only need to do this step once).

Finally, run `npm run test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed. While they are open in a terminal window, these tests will re-run every time you save server files. If you want to quit the testing loop, use `Ctrl + C`. If you only want to run the tests once, you can run the `mocha` command in the terminal from your project root directory.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to ensure you are implementing your routes and middleware correctly. The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated when first writing your routes. You should also test the functionality on the frontend to make sure that things are working as intended. Feel free to add logging middleware to your server, it will help with debugging!
